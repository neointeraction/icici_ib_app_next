                  The AMC considers Environmental, Social, and Governance
                  Factors as key influencers for delivering superior long-term
                  shareholder value. As active managers, ESG issues are given
                  due consideration while evaluating companies on an ongoing
                  basis. A formal ESG policy is in place and all investment
                  professionals are responsible for incorporating ESG related
                  issues in their decision-making process. In addition to
                  internal scores, the AMC also subscribes to leading
                  third-party ESG scores which guide sector specialists in the
                  rating process. The AMC is an advisor to an ESG compliant
                  UCITS offshore equity fund since 2012 and also manages ESG
                  Equity Mutual Fund Scheme in India since 2020.
